**  2.14  Released XX XXXX 201X **

 * SMALL CHANGES *
   - temporarily added the ~/nadiv/R/makeAinv2.R file NEED to DELETE 
   - changed the remlSupport.R file to make pcc() return FALSE if the object (asreml) shows the log-likelihood did not converge
   - changed drfx.R to properly index the fx object [fix of an error that was generated when the factor names did not convert into a sequence of integers that was 1:nrow(dataf)]. Also changed dim()[1] to either nrow() or ncol().

**  2.13.2  Released 20 June 2014 **

 * SMALL CHANGES *
   - added the calculation of the log determinant of the A matrix to makeAinv().  log(det(A^-1)) = log(1) - log(det(A)) using the property of determinants that det(A^-1) = 1 / det(A) = det(A)^-1.
   - changed "free(AN);" and "free(li);" in ainv.cc, makea.cc, and sinv.cc files to "delete[] AN;" and "delete[] li;" 
   - changed grfx() to be faster when taking the cholesky factorization of diagonal incidence matrices (construction using Diagonal() and not diag())
   - removed "dii" from makeAinv() and "ainv.cc"
   - made makeA() faster by returning inverse of cholesky factorization of the A-inverse matrix and then using chol2inv() from R to obtain A. Deleted "makea.cc" and included "acinv" in "ainv.cc"


**  2.13  Released 16 June 2014 **
 * NEW *
   - added the prepPed() and prepPed.Rd to prepare pedigrees for use in other functions - namely that all founders are identified and have an ID in the ID column and that individuals don't appear in rows before their Dam or Sire.
   - exported makeAinv() and added makeAinv.Rd
   - added ggcontrib.R and ggcontrib.Rd so that genetic group contributions can be calculated
 	- still need to implement functionality for "fuzzy classification"
   - added reT.cc and reT.h to /src to allow for selfing
   - added remlSupport.R which contains the pin() and pcc() functions for the delta method and parameter value convergence checking, respectively, for asreml type REML models.  Also added the pin.Rd and pcc.Rd help/documentation files.  NOTE, pin() is not exported in this version (need nadiv:::pin() to use it)
   - added makeDufam(), but did not export it.  This is an experimental version of makeD that first sorts individuals according to generation and then dam, and then sire.  This sticks individuals with the same parents next to each other in the pedigree - the new "dijskip" function in "dij.cc" takes a short cut in that it assigns the coefficient of fraternity from the previous individual to the current individual if these two individuals have the exact same parent.  Haven't implemented a parallel version of this c++ code yet (and haven't checked the overall function for timing/memory benefits or accuracy).
   
 * SMALL CHANGES *
   - changed DESCRIPTION file to reflect the package asreml (not in the repositories) is suggested and now the Description field indicates where to obtain this package (as per change in CRAN policy)
   - changed makeDomEpi() argument "Dinverse" to "invertD" to be similar to makeD() - also changed makeDomEpi.Rd file to reflect these changes.
   - changed numPed() and numPed.Rd to point to the new function prepPed() for preparing a pedigree
   - added the pcc() function checks to the constrainFun() function so that it only returns likelihood ratio test statistics if the constrained model has converged in both the loglikelihood as well as the parameter estimates.
   - lumped the following C++ files in nadiv/src: "dijp.cc" and new "dijskip.cc" pasted into "dij.cc" & "gaUnsort.cc" was put into "ga.cc".
   - removed dependency of proLik() on the asreml:::asreml.ltri2mat() and instead use my aiFun()


#####    NEED TO MORE THOROUGHLY DOCUMENT CHANGES TO BELOW - VERY INCOMPLETE

** 2.9 **
 * NEW *
   - enabled parallel processing (forking, so no Windows compatability) in:
     findDFC(), makeD(), makeDsim()

** 2.8 **
 - changed name of FindDFC() to findDFC()
