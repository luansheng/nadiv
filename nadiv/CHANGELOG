Code changes tracked using git and can be viewed at: github.com/matthewwolak/nadiv

**  2.13.3  Released 30 May 2015 **
 * NEW *
   - Added LDtL(), a function to take the LDL' Cholesky decomposition of a matrix (not currently exported).
   - Added founderLine() and help file which traces all individuals back to either the paternal or maternal founder
   - grfx() now has a new argument to allow user to supply the standard normal deviates instead of generating them within the function.
      - extended the warn argument to apply to the warning when incidence = NULL
      - updated grfx.Rd with an example illustrating the stdnorms argument
      - added ... argument to drfx() so that arguments for the internal use of grfx() can be supplied to drfx().
   - argument now allows specified prefix for all identities in a pedigree generated from simPedHS() or simPedDFC().
   - argument added that specifies output format of ggcontrib(), default is "matrix"

 * SMALL CHANGES *
   - removed 'asreml' from suggests in the package DESCRIPTION file.
   - changed the remlSupport.R file to make pcc() return FALSE if the object (asreml) shows the log-likelihood did not converge
   - changed remlSupport.R and pcc.Rd to add a silent = FALSE agrument to pcc() so that the default can be changed to not show messages
	- helpful in simulations where a lot of output would be printed on screen
   - changed the signs associated with likelihood ratio test statistics, etc.
      - changed constrainFun.R so that the absolute value of the difference in log-likelihoods is returned ALSO removed the negative from the 2
      - changed signs in proLik.R so that profile likelihoods should be "valleys" (instead of "hills", as they were in versions previous to 2.13.3)
      - plot.proLik.R now reflects these changes in sign
   - title in the description file was shortened



**  2.13.2  Released 20 June 2014 **
 * SMALL CHANGES *
   - added the calculation of the log determinant of the A matrix to makeAinv()
	- log(det(A^-1)) = log(1) - log(det(A))
	- usies property of determinants that det(A^-1) = 1 / det(A) = det(A)^-1.
   - changed "free(AN);" and "free(li);" in ainv.cc, makea.cc, and sinv.cc files to "delete[] AN;" and "delete[] li;" 
   - changed grfx() to be faster when taking the cholesky factorization of diagonal incidence matrices
	- construction using Diagonal() and not diag()
   - made makeA() return the inverse of cholesky factorization of the A-inverse matrix
	- then us chol2inv() from R to obtain A
	- deleted "makea.cc" and included "acinv" in "ainv.cc"
	- faster unless A is dense.



**  2.13  Released 16 June 2014 **
 * NEW *
   - added the prepPed() and prepPed.Rd to prepare pedigrees for use in other functions
   - exported makeAinv() and added makeAinv.Rd
   - added ggcontrib.R and ggcontrib.Rd so that genetic group contributions can be calculated
 	- still need to implement functionality for "fuzzy classification"
   - added reT.cc and reT.h to /src to allow for selfing
   - added remlSupport.R which contains the pin() and pcc() functions for the delta method and parameter value convergence checking, respectively, for asreml type REML models.  Also added the pin.Rd and pcc.Rd help/documentation files.
	- NOTE, pin() is not exported in this version (need nadiv:::pin() to use it)
   - added makeDufam(), but did not export it.
	- experimental version of makeD that first sorts individuals according to generation and then dam, and then sire.  This sticks individuals with the same parents next to each other in the pedigree - the new "dijskip" function in "dij.cc" takes a short cut
	- haven't implemented a parallel version of this c++ code yet (or checked function for timing/memory benefits or accuracy).
   
 * SMALL CHANGES *
   - changed makeDomEpi() argument "Dinverse" to "invertD" to be similar to makeD()
	- also changed makeDomEpi.Rd file to reflect these changes.
   - changed numPed() and numPed.Rd to point to the new function prepPed() for preparing a pedigree
   - added the pcc() function checks to the constrainFun() function so that it only returns likelihood ratio test statistics if the constrained model has converged in both the loglikelihood as well as the parameter estimates.
   - lumped the following C++ files in nadiv/src: "dijp.cc" and new "dijskip.cc" pasted into "dij.cc" & "gaUnsort.cc" was put into "ga.cc".
   - removed dependency of proLik() on the asreml:::asreml.ltri2mat() and instead use my aiFun()


##    INCOMPLETE BELOW  ##


** 2.9 **
 * NEW *
   - enabled parallel processing (forking, so no Windows compatability) in:
     findDFC(), makeD(), makeDsim()

** 2.8 **
 - changed name of FindDFC() to findDFC()
